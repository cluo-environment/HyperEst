## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation, make sure the following dependencies are available on your system:

- **Conda 23.11.0** (Miniconda or Anaconda)  
  If you do not have Conda installed, download and install it from the [official Miniconda website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).


### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cluo-environment/HyperEst.git
    cd HyperEst
    ```
2.  **Create the Conda Environment:**
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```
3.  **Activate the environment:**
    ```bash
    conda activate HyperEst
    ```
